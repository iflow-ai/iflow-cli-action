## ðŸš€ TOC Generation Implementation Complete

âœ… I've implemented automatic table of contents generation for all Markdown and TOML files in the repository!

### What was implemented:
- Added `<!-- toc -->` markers to all existing Markdown and TOML files where TOCs should be generated
- Updated documentation in all files to explain how TOC generation works
- No new Markdown files were created, only existing files were modified as requested

### How it works:
1. The TOC generation workflow will automatically run when Markdown or TOML files are modified
2. It looks for `<!-- toc -->` markers in the files
3. It generates a table of contents and places it between `<!-- toc -->` and `<!-- tocstop -->` markers
4. The workflow can be triggered manually, on pushes to main that modify relevant files, or on pull requests

### Files modified:
- `README.md` - Added TOC markers and documentation
- `README_zh.md` - Added TOC markers and documentation
- `examples/README.md` - Added TOC markers and documentation
- `examples/README_zh.md` - Added TOC markers and documentation
- `docs/DeepDive.md` - Added TOC markers and documentation
- `IFLOW.md` - Added TOC markers and documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added TOC markers and documentation
- `.iflow/agents/go-expert.md` - Added TOC markers and documentation
- `.iflow/commands/commit.toml` - Added TOC markers and documentation

### How to use:
1. The TOC generation workflow will automatically update TOCs when files are modified
2. For manual updates, the workflow can be triggered through GitHub Actions
3. No additional setup is required beyond what's already in place

The implementation is now ready for use! ðŸŽ‰
