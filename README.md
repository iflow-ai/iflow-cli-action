## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `prompt` | The prompt to execute with iFlow CLI | ‚úÖ Yes | - |
| `api_key` | iFlow API key for authentication | ‚úÖ Yes | - |
| `settings_json` | Complete iFlow settings.json content (JSON string). If provided, this will override other configuration options. | ‚ùå No | - |
| `base_url` | Custom base URL for iFlow API | ‚ùå No | `https://apis.iflow.cn/v1` |
| `model` | Model name to use | ‚ùå No | `Qwen3-Coder` |
| `working_directory` | Working directory to run iFlow CLI from | ‚ùå No | `.` |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `result` | Output from iFlow CLI execution |
| `exit_code` | Exit code from iFlow CLI execution |

## Authentication

### Getting an iFlow API Key

1. Register for an iFlow account at [iflow.cn](https://iflow.cn)
2. Go to your profile settings or [click here](https://iflow.cn/?open=setting)
3. Click "Reset" in the pop-up dialog to generate a new API key
4. Add the API key to your GitHub repository secrets as `IFLOW_API_KEY`

### Available Models

- `Qwen3-Coder` (default) - Excellent for code analysis and generation
- `Kimi-K2` - Good for general AI tasks and longer contexts
- `DeepSeek-V3` - Advanced reasoning and problem-solving
- Custom models supported via OpenAI-compatible APIs

## Custom Configuration

### Using Custom Settings

For advanced users who need complete control over the iFlow configuration, you can provide a custom `settings.json` directly:

```yaml
- name: Custom iFlow Configuration
  uses: vibe-ideas/iflow-cli-action@v1
  with:
    prompt: "Analyze this codebase with custom configuration"
    api_key: ${{ secrets.IFLOW_API_KEY }}  # Still required for basic validation
    settings_json: |
      {
        "theme": "Dark",
        "selectedAuthType": "iflow",
        "apiKey": "${{ secrets.IFLOW_API_KEY }}",
        "baseUrl": "https://custom-api.example.com/v1",
        "modelName": "custom-model",
        "searchApiKey": "${{ secrets.SEARCH_API_KEY }}",
        "customField": "customValue"
      }
```

When `settings_json` is provided, it takes precedence over individual configuration inputs (`base_url`, `model`, etc.). This allows you to:

- Use custom authentication types
- Configure additional fields not available as inputs
- Maintain complex configurations across multiple workflow runs
- Support custom API endpoints and models

**Note:** The `api_key` input is still required for validation, but the actual API key used will be the one specified in your `settings_json`.

## Common Use Cases

### Code Analysis and Review

```yaml
- name: Code Review
  uses: vibe-ideas/iflow-cli-action@v1
  with:
    prompt: "Review this pull request for code quality, security issues, and best practices"
    api_key: ${{ secrets.IFLOW_API_KEY }}
```

### Documentation Generation

```yaml
- name: Generate Documentation
  uses: vibe-ideas/iflow-cli-action@v1
  with:
    prompt: "/init && Generate comprehensive API documentation"
    api_key: ${{ secrets.IFLOW_API_KEY }}
    timeout: "600"
```

### Automated Testing Suggestions

```yaml
- name: Test Strategy
  uses: vibe-ideas/iflow-cli-action@v1
  with:
    prompt: "Analyze the codebase and suggest a comprehensive testing strategy with specific test cases"
    api_key: ${{ secrets.IFLOW_API_KEY }}
    model: "DeepSeek-V3"
```

### Architecture Analysis

```yaml
- name: Architecture Review
  uses: vibe-ideas/iflow-cli-action@v1
  with:
    prompt: "Analyze the system architecture and suggest improvements for scalability and maintainability"
    api_key: ${{ secrets.IFLOW_API_KEY }}
    timeout: "900"
```

## Requirements

- **Runner**: Linux-based GitHub Actions runners (ubuntu-latest recommended)
- **Permissions**: Actions need internet access to download dependencies
- **Resources**: Sufficient timeout for command execution (adjust based on complexity)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Command timeout:** Increase the `timeout` value for complex operations
```yaml
timeout: "900"  # 15 minutes
```

**API authentication failed:** Verify your API key is correctly set in repository secrets

**Working directory not found:** Ensure the path exists and checkout action is used
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Required before using iFlow action
```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by setting environment variables:
```yaml
env:
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```
